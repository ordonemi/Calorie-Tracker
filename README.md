# Calorie-Tracker
Overview
This project is aimed at demonstrating the user of Django and Python in web development, specifically how it facilitates the development and deployment of web based applications. This project was meant to help me build a foundational knowlegde usng Django and Python to develop and host web applications.

For this project, I opted to write a calorie tracker application, which is meant to make tracking your daily caloric intake easier. To be able to start a test server, you only needs to install the modules found in the 'requirements.txt' file and run the server by typing 'python manage.py runserver' in the terminal. The test server will begin and you will need to navitage to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' to see the application.

The purpose behind writing this software, was to use what I've learned in Django and Python to implement a web application that can accurately track your daily caloric intake. The application will take user input and add/subtract from a total counter for calories. The user will also be able to set caloric goals, and save their entries.

Web Pages
The main page of the web application displays three things, an input section , a total count section, and a section to add a caloric goal. The user will be able to enter the amount of calories they consumed after a meal or snack into the input box, and then either add to or subtract from the total count using the respective buttons. As the user adds or subtracts calories, the total count will change dynamically. The user will also have the opportunity to add a daily caloric goal. The other page in the web app will keep a track of everry addition to the total count shown as log entries.
